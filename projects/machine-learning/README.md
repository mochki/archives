# Machine Learning Algorithms

Numerous machine learning or data mining algorithms. Some I completely made
from scratch and others i just used. Mostly Python but some are in R, using
both nominal and numerical datasets.

- 1: k Nearest Neighbors
- 2: Decision Trees
- 3: Neural Networks
- 4: Apriori
- 5: Clustering
- 6: Social Networking Analysis
- 7: Support Vector Machines
- 8: Ensemble

Requires `numpy pyplot sklearn`
