# Sudoku + Solver

A little command line program to play some Sudoku. You also have the option to have it solve it for you, but that sort of defeats the purpose of playing Sudoku. Written in C++ for my class in my pre-OOP days.

## Usability

Compile and run. Feed it a Sudoku board and play with the following inputs:

```
Options:
   ?  Show these instructions
   D  Display the board
   E  Edit one square
   S  Show the possible values for a square
   F  Finish the Puzzle
   Q  Save and Quit
```
