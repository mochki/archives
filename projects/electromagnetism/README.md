# Electric & Magnetic Field Simulations

Basically a bunch of computation exercises for electromagnetic physics. Only works with specific input formats but we do things that would be pretty impossible to do by hand.

- Project 1: Electrical Field of Many Point Charges
- Project 2: Electrical Field of a Continuous Charge Distribution
- Project 3: Electrical Field of Many Point Charges ... Via Gradient
- Project 4: Motion of a Charged Particle in an Electric Field
- Project 5: Calculating Equivalent Resistances
- Project 6: Motion of a Charged Particle in a Magnetic Field
